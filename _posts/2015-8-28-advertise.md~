title: How to place ads on Simple Android Server
---

Simple Android Server is a mobile proxy server that lets you take control of all outgoing http requests on your android device and already has hundreds of thousands of users from around the world but currently we have most of our users from Nigeria. We have more than **200,000** Nigerian users daily.

Simple Android server currently generated more than **5,000,000** impressions last month for Admob and adds up to **800 - 1,000** new Nigerian users per day.

If you are interested in targeting those users please send a mail to ***zolaballantyne@gmail.com*** with your ad creatives and details of your campaign. We will accept mobile banner ads (dimesions): 
<ul>
<li>(320 x 50)</li>
<li>(216 x 36)</li>
<li>(300 x 50)</li>
</ul>
Interstitial ads (dimensions):
<ul>
<li>(720 x 90)</li>
<li>(480 X 60)</li>
</ul>

You can choose whether you want to be charged based on CPC (*Cost per Click*) or CPM (*per thousand impressions*) but whichever choice you make, you will be billed **$0.15** for banner ads and **0.18** for interstitial ads per event.

Reports will be sent to your email weekly or monthly or even daily depending on your preference.
